## USING

These light sources require a Hall script to operate : https://tebex.criticalscripts.shop/package/4517971
These light sources made specifically for use with the script.
If you use them without the script, you'll just get very bright blinding light sources

```lua
        {
            ['soundSyncType'] = SOUND_SYNC_TYPE.BASS,
            ['hash'] = 'stg_strobe_hdgh',
            ['position'] = vector3(-1431.638, -1349.572, 5.029),
            ['rotation'] = vector3(-179.223, -0.000, -3.385),
            ['heading'] = nil,
            ['lodDistance'] = nil,
            ['color'] = {255, 1, 1}
        },
```
