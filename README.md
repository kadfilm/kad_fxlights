## INSTALLATION 
Download

## USING

These light sources require a **[CS-HALL](https://tebex.criticalscripts.shop/package/4517971)** script to operate
These light sources made specifically for use with the script.
If you use them without the script, you'll just get very bright blinding light sources

```lua
        {
            ['soundSyncType'] = SOUND_SYNC_TYPE.BASS,
            ['hash'] = 'stg_strobe_hdgh',
            ['position'] = vector3(-1431.638, -1349.572, 5.029),
            ['rotation'] = vector3(-179.223, -0.000, -3.385),
            ['heading'] = nil,
            ['lodDistance'] = nil,
            ['color'] = {255, 1, 1}
        },
```

## How to use projectors

1. Place projector
2. Add to your replacers these two lines
   ```lua
                ['h4_prop_battle_lights'] = 'pyd_disco_gobo_b',
                ['stg_tex'] = 'stg_proj',
   ```
